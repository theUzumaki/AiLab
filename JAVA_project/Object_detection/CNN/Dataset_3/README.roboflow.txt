The dataset includes 1844 images.
Obstacle are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 2 pixels
